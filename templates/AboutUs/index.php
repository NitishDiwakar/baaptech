                            <p>We are the front which is fighting against pharma controlled politicans, who are making decisons to inject us with unknown substances, on basis of some fake imaginary virus come join us, if you wana survive n thrive, fake science is there weapon, pimp politicans are there weapon, which are cooperating to inject people with vaccines, every day they come up with new variants, which are basically computer simulation, with new variants comes new booster dose. </p>
                            <p>pharma through pimp politicans make there medicines mandatory, which is damaging health, all the things which works, were banned by govt when this fake pandemic they played wrong medicines, mistreatment killed people which they then blame it on virus (which doesnt even exist). </p>
                            <p>
                                govt can do this again n again until people realise, resistance is the only choice, more you comply more vaccines you get. 
                            </p>
                            <p>Their health policy is fake and designed to make people sick, when they talk about health, they actually talk about vaccines. </p>
                            <br>
                            <p>
                                
They have setup there task force in entire india, the only purpose of this task force is to inject people with vaccines, they even go to very remote places n inject people there with vaccines. the whole system is designed to inject people with vaccines, govt is there pimp, unless we have united front against them, they will continue to imagine new virus and then the only solution is vaccine.<br><br>

These people dream 24/7 about injecting people with vaccines.<br><br>

Almost every politican is there pimp, no 1 opposes them, they are working with pharma to inject as many people as they can with vaccines.<br>

according to them vaccines is the only solution for everything.<br>

They make policies to inject us, who are they to decide what to inject, they make it mandatory through rules n deception, fake science and their media mainstream media is owned by them, which coninously host actor scientist as health expert and spread misinformation which is actually to the health of people We are the front which opposes them join us.<br>

there are plenty of other issues, join us to fight fake science, imaginary viruses, pimp politicans, central bankers backed by nothing money printer<br>

they control us through fake money, fake science, n pimp politicans<br>

we will fight election, we will win election, we will be the administration, only way to take back control, is we control the system<br>

BAAP is the political front of awakend social workers, who wants to do something about this situation
